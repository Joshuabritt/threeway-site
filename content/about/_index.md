Hi, I’m **Joshua Britt** — founder of ThreeWay Mobile Evidence Services.

I was born in **Humboldt, Tennessee**, and grew up in a small community just outside Jackson called **Three Way**. The name of my business is a tribute to those roots. My grandfather owned the **Antique City Mall**, a well-loved local fixture that was housed in the old **Fairview High School** building, originally built in the 1920s. That sense of history, hard work, and community shaped who I am.

This business was born out of one of the most difficult chapters of my life. During a divorce and custody battle, I found myself scrambling to gather digital evidence — text messages, call logs, and app conversations — that could support my case in court. My attorney told me to "go figure it out," and that left me spending countless hours researching, testing software, and struggling to extract messages from my phone into a format that could actually be used at a hearing.

That experience taught me something: if I, a college professor with tech knowledge and experience, found this process overwhelming and exhausting, how much harder must it be for others facing the same legal pressure?

So I decided to turn that pain into purpose.

For nearly two decades, I've been teaching statistics and mathematics at a community college in **Jackson, Tennessee**. My passion has always been helping students overcome anxiety and confusion to achieve success. Now, I bring that same mindset to my work with clients — creating a calm, trustworthy, and straightforward process for extracting mobile data for legal needs.

At **ThreeWay Mobile Evidence Services**, my goal is simple:  
To help you feel a sense of control and peace during a stressful time.  

Whether you're working with an attorney or handling things on your own, I’m here to make sure your digital evidence is retrieved cleanly, clearly, and on time — so you can focus on what matters most.
