Hi, I’m Joshua Britt—founder of ThreeWay Mobile Evidence Services.

Several years ago, I found myself in a courtroom, caught in the middle of one of life's toughest moments—a divorce and custody battle. I needed proof: text messages, call logs, conversations from apps. But when I asked my lawyer how to get that digital evidence, his reply stunned me: "Go figure it out."

I spent countless sleepless nights struggling to extract data from my phone, wrestling with confusing software and trying to organize conversations into something a judge could understand. Despite being a college professor with almost two decades of experience in statistics and mathematics, I felt completely overwhelmed.

It made me wonder: If someone with my background finds this difficult, how much harder must it be for everyone else?

That's when the idea for ThreeWay Mobile Evidence Services took shape. I wanted to transform that stress and confusion into clarity and peace of mind for others going through similar battles.

I grew up near Jackson, Tennessee, in a small community named Three Way—a place defined by family, history, and a deep sense of community. My grandfather owned Antique City Mall, a beloved local landmark housed in the historic Fairview High School building from the 1920s. Those roots taught me the value of trust, hard work, and helping others through tough times.

At ThreeWay Mobile Evidence Services, my mission is clear:

> **To simplify the complex process of gathering digital evidence, so you feel empowered and supported when you need it most.**

No technical jargon, no endless frustration—just straightforward solutions, delivered with compassion and professionalism. Because when you're facing a legal challenge, you shouldn't have to do it alone.

I'm here, ready to help you reclaim a sense of calm and confidence.
