Hi, I'm **Joshua Britt**, founder of **ThreeWay Mobile Evidence Services**.

I was born in Humboldt, Tennessee and raised in the Three Way community — just down the road from the old Fairview High School building, which once housed the Antique City Mall. It was here, surrounded by history and hard work, that I developed the values of persistence, integrity, and service that define my life and this business.

ThreeWay Mobile Evidence Services was born out of personal struggle. During a difficult divorce and child custody battle, I experienced firsthand how frustrating it was to extract and present critical text messages and digital records in a format my attorney could actually use in court. I spent countless hours trying to make my digital evidence usable and admissible — often feeling alone and overwhelmed in the process.

That experience inspired me to create a service that could spare others from the same stress.

For nearly 20 years, I’ve taught mathematics at a local college in Jackson, Tennessee. My passion for helping people understand difficult things — whether in the classroom or the courtroom — drives everything I do. This business is a natural extension of that mission: to support clients with fast, clear, and attorney-ready mobile data extraction so they can focus on their case, not on the tech.

I started this company to help others overcome the same uphill battle I once faced. If you’re in the middle of a legal fight and need help making sense of your phone’s data, I’m here to make sure you don’t go through it alone.
