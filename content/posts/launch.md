Hi, Iâ€™m Joshua Britt â€” founder of ThreeWay Mobile Evidence Services.

I started this business after going through my own legal struggles, where I needed to extract messages and call logs from my phone to help my attorney build a strong case. The process was frustrating, technical, and time-consuming â€” so I turned that experience into a service that helps others do it **faster, cleaner, and without the stress**.

We now offer:
- ðŸ“± Text message exports (SMS & iMessage)
- ðŸ“ž Call log exports
- ðŸ’¬ App message exports (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.)
- ðŸ“‚ Full digital export packages for legal use

Whether youâ€™re a client needing evidence or an attorney needing clean, court-ready data â€” weâ€™re here to make it simple.

Letâ€™s get started.
